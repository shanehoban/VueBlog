# VueBlog via Contentful

VueBlog is a blog powered by VueJS on the frontend.

VueBlog utilizes Contentful for the blog post content. To use VueBlog, you will need to sign up for a Contentful account, which provides access to their APIs.

## Demo

There should be a live version of this available at [shanehoban.com/vueblog](https://www.shanehoban.com/vueblog).

## Changelog

A changelog post has been created on the blog and should be available [here](https://www.shanehoban.com/vueblog/#/post/683qaLiSk5tHDKKNeudzRf).

## Contentful Model Guide

TODO: Create a guide for creating the Contentful models required for VueBlog.

## Settings

Most if not all of the front end configuration settings you need to change have been condensed into `src/blog.config.js` and are pretty self explanatory.
