# VueBlog

This is a VueJS Blog Frontend, that utilizes Contentful for the blog post content. Feel free to use it as you wish, and simply update your Contentful API endpoint (it's read only in this anyhow).

There should be a live version of this available at [https://www.shanehoban.com/vueblog](https://www.shanehoban.com/vueblog)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
