# VueBlog via Contentful

This is a VueJS Blog Frontend, that utilizes Contentful for the blog post content. Feel free to use it as you wish, and simply update your Contentful API endpoint (it's read only in this anyhow).

## Demo

There should be a live version of this available at [shanehoban.com/vueblog](https://www.shanehoban.com/vueblog).

## Changelog

A changelog post has been created on the blog and should be available [here](https://www.shanehoban.com/vueblog/#/post/683qaLiSk5tHDKKNeudzRf).

## Settings

Most if not all of the front end configuration settings you need to change have been condensed into `src/blog.config.js` and are pretty self explanatory.

## Contentful Model Guide

TODO: Create a guide for creating the Contentful models.

## Building This Project

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
